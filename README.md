```

# List all pending tasks
rtask list
rtask ls
rtask log

# List all tasks including completed ones
rtask list --all
rtask ls -a

# List only completed tasks
rtask list --completed
rtask ls -c

# Filter tasks by tag
rtask list --filter work
rtask ls -f work
```

# Mark a task as complete by ID
rtask complete 1
rtask done 1

```

### Interactive Mode

Launch the interactive mode by running `rtask` without any commands:

```

## Task Storage

By default, tasks are stored in your home directory:

- Windows: `C:\Users\halo\.rtasks\tasks.json`

You can change this location during configuration.
